# Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis, It is an approach used in data analysis to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, often using visual methods. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process, allowing data scientists and analysts to understand the data's structure, detect patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through statistical summaries and graphical representations.

In this project, I used a data_clean dataset, loaded into a DataFrame, where I performed the following steps:

- **Checked for Null Values**: Identified and handled any missing values in the dataset.
- **Checked for Duplicate Values**: Detected and removed any duplicate entries.
- **Calculated Statistical Measures**: Computed the mean, median, and mode to understand the central tendency of the data.
- **Dealt with Missing Values**: Implemented strategies to address missing data, such as imputation or removal.
